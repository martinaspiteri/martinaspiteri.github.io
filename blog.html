            <p>

There is the Ceramics Museum, which is the principal attraction in the town center. However, the city offers also you many things to do. In June, there is one of the oldest jousting tournaments.The five districts of the town enliven the whole month of June with challenges between flag-throwers and drummers.

                Faenza is undoubtedly the capital of ceramics. It is one of the most renowned centres for majolica in the world. The very name faiences originates from that of the town.

The most important edifice to represent ceramic pottery in Faenza is the International Ceramics Museum (MIC), founded in 1908 by Gaetano Ballardini. It is home to ceramic masterpieces from the Renaissance. Moreover, there is also another museum, which pays tribute to the famous sculptor Carlo Zauli who was awarded 3 times for his work.

On the other hand, Faenza hosts a special event called 'Mondial Tornianti' which is organised every year in Nenni square. This special occasion gathers many ceramic producers from all over the world who masterfully give shape to some of humanity's most incredible pieces of ceramic art. The competition is divided into two different categories: aesthetic and technical, the goal of the latter being to produce the largest dish or the tallest vase. In this corner of Faenza you can feel the international atmosphere: the town welcomes many foreign students who study history and production of ceramics at the National Art Ceramic Institute.            </p>

In addition, you can also enjoy a variety of desserts such as migliaccio, tortelli di San Lazzaro and also Romagna's delicious nectarines and chestnuts which have grown in the area for centuries.

            <h2>Bologna</h2>

            <p>
				Originally Etruscan, the city has been one of the most important urban centres for centuries, first under the Etruscans (who called it Felsina), then under the Celts as Bona, later under the Romans, then again in the Middle Ages, as a free municipality and signoria, when it was among the largest European cities by population. Famous for its towers, churches and lengthy porticoes, Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, thanks to a careful restoration and conservation policy which began at the end of the 1970s. Home to the oldest university in the world,the University of Bologna, established in AD 1088, the city has a large student population that gives it a cosmopolitan character. In 2000 it was declared European capital of culture and in 2006, a UNESCO "City of Music" and became part of the Creative Cities Network

                Bologna is an important agricultural, industrial, financial and transport hub, where many large mechanical, electronic and food companies have their headquarters as well as one of the largest permanent trade fairs in Europe. According to the most recent data gathered by the European Regional Economic Growth Index of 2009, Bologna is the first Italian city and the 47th European city in terms of its economic growth rate.
